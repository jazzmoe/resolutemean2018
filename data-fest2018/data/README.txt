Description:

In an eight-month honeynet project, TÜV SÜD recorded over 60,000
unwanted accesses and attempts to break into a virtual infrastructure, a
water works of a small Bavarian city. The honeynet combined real hard-
and software with a simulated environment of a small-scale water works.
Scans and attacks were launched from all over the world, sometimes using
spoofed IP addresses. TÜV SÜD’s honeynet project proved that targeted
attacks on infrastructures and production facilities are no longer
isolated events.

Industry 4.0 presents companies with the challenging task of having to
reconsider their security policy from the bottom up. Increasing
digitization, standardization and interconnectivity makes
infrastructures and industrial facilities more vulnerable and opens up
new “opportunities” for possible misuse and abuse – from espionage to
sabotage. TÜV SÜD used a high-interaction honeynet to gain new insights
which will benefit companies of all industries.


A honeynet is a decoy network designed to attract attacks, allowing
detailed analysis of the access and attack methods to be conducted. For
this project, TÜV SÜD simulated the network of a water works in a small
German town. To do so, TÜV SÜD established a high-interaction honeynet,
which combined real hard- and software with a virtual environment. The
security measures corresponded to the current levels found in industry.
To ensure a realistic system structure and authentic security
precautions, TÜV SÜD’s experts worked with representatives from the
utilities sector during development and implementation.


The honeynet was deployed on the Internet for a total period of eight
months. The first access attempt happened virtually at the same time to
its “going live”.

Questions:

TÜV SÜD would like to make the network traffic data, that were
collected during the 8 months that the honeynet was online, available to
students at the datafest Germany 2018 for them to develop and test automated
forensic analysis methods and tools in order to qualify and test for various
cybersecurity attack vectors and events. The data analysis results can be
compared to previous methods used to identify break-in attempts into this
simulated water works infrastructure.

Of interest will be the actual number of detected security breaches,
the attack vectors, the protocols used, country of origin of the
involved IP addresses, and any additional information that might be of
interest and that can be extracted.
